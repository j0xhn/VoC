**A note to the reader:**
Please read my [context](./context.md) and [history files](./myFormation.md) and go back through the previous versions to understand how I came to my current views for a more broad and insightful understanding.

# My View of Consiousness
Consciousness is a type of growing organism that spans space and time and exists in us as it does in animals, plants etc.  This consciousness instils yearnings and hungering in the material of this reality as it's mechanism for growth.  I believe this to be `God` -- but don't want to inherit pre-concieved notions when trying to explain my view to others, so will use the acronym `URGE - Underlying Recessive Gravitational Existance`. 

Simply put, God is Love.  The literal idea/feeling/expression/quest/purpose of love.  As soon as we try to put it into words, images or metaphors we fall short, and as soon as we try to understand what it feels like to someone else, we immediately understand that we cannot.  It's personally intimate, yet universal. 

How this being came into existance, is beyond my concern yet I still like to think about it.  It could have been in the middle of space, when nothing suddenly exploded into something. It could have began between rock & ocean in some type of lichen or moss. Bacteria and minerals joined with light and lightning from the sun and sky on this planet or possibly another. 

We are intertwined with our urges and the urges of others.  It exists in and around us. The part is an essential piece of the whole and the whole doesn't exist without the part. We are at the same time seperated and joined but at different locations in space, and different intervals in time like atoms in a river that split and then join back in on itself like the branches of lightning: imperceptible to our natural senses.  We don't actually ever see lighting, we only see the effects it has on our natural world. However we can feel it when it runs through our body.


Through time humans have tried to define and understand our URGE to do both good and evil things.  Many traditions have formed writings, rules and models -- that while incomplete or wrong in some ways -- are often usefull in helping society move forward on the same page.  The idea of God continues to evolve according to societies needs, often borrowing old ideas and incorporating new urges that we need to address. It's an internal discovery proccess, both in how we deal with ourselves but also how we deal with others.

I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God. 

Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.  

It is and will always be a personal thing, yet always requires at least two. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them. Its different to everyone and yet, the same to everyone. It is the idea of love, and that love is made manifest through my actions, and the actions of others. 

One who says they comprehend that which is incomprehesible is by definition immediately mistook - we are to seek

We are connected - The Body of Christ
It is above light/dark - first/last
Encompasing of all we can imagine
Alpha and Omega

Love.
