# My View of Human Consiousness
Try to keep to 1,000 lines with ample references and documentation to allow readers to go down whichever rabbit hole they desire.

* note: as of writing this first draft it is actually a recount of my past belief structures.  I will record them here, then update accordingly, all writings in the first versions should be viewed under the lense that it is retrospective and hence might not be true representations of how I actually felt in the moment.  I will start around the age 18 and work up to my current age of 30 :)

# My Awakening
The LDS (Mormon) faith holds it important for all males that adhere to it's commandments to spend 2 years preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ with the aims of brining people to baptism.  Females are also given the opportunity, but at the time of my youth it was strong in the culture that males are expected to go.

On that mission a common tool for helping people along their spiritual path is to show where you were on your own spiritual path through "bearing your testimony".  This typically goes something like "I know Jesus Christ is my savior, I know Joseph Smith to be his prophet that he chose in the latter days to restore his living church here on the earth.  We can know this by reading the Book of Mormon which was a fruit of Joseph Smith.  I know that the Book of Mormon is true.  I know that the LDS faith is the true church"

A lot of emphasis is put on "knowing" and "truth".  This impacted me in a very deep and at time, painful way.  Being that I didn't know this truth.  I did the steps that they asked me to do, I read the scriptures, prayed, fasted (once for 2 days off and on) and the big takeaway that I had was in reading scriptures such as [Alma 5.46](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/alma/5.46?lang=eng#p45) and [Mosiah 27.22](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/mosiah/27.23?lang=eng#p21) and (another story that I can't remember that I need to look up) -- that I felt very impressed that I would have a dream that would teach me the truth.  What proceeded was a normalish dream, nothing about the LDS church or Christ really.  (will look back and write actual dream) -- from that point on I started writing my dreams and I think this really awakened my inner sense of mystism.  This heavy handed teaching of a church that you must KNOW THE TRUTH -- then seeking the truth -- and what's weird is that the truth I found was not the truth that they were telling me I'd find.  Which lead to, as I put in my journal, some of the darkest times of my life.  Feeling that lifeboat had been taken from me, and now I was drowning.  Always reaching out for something to grab onto, but it evaporating before me as I tried to grasp it.  Seeing others proclaim to "know" yet I unable to achieve.  I was losing.  I was lost. I had to learn to let go and pull out.

Of course this ebbed and flowed.  It wasn't an "all at once" aha moment, I mean it was and it wasn't.  Like I had that aha moment, makes sense, but then the old patterns creep back in.  And it cultivated really once I got off my mission and was attending BYU.  I was trying so hard to compete, was doing freelance video production, had started a company called `(kno) Name` and going to school full time and the weight of competing on all these levels drove me to break down into tears at night while watching [youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahv_1IS7SiE) and go into states of depression.  It was less of depression, and more a feeling of complete emptyness and loss of meaning of life.

What finally kicked it into focus is when I visited a school counselor.  After a few sessions we had this discussion about how I felt like I was a dog at a track.  Having a carrot dangled in front of my face, chasing as fast as I could and regardless of how fast I ran I could not ever achieve the goal.  As a human watching the race you know that physically it is impossible for the dog to ever be faster than the machine, so they are set at an impossible task, like the man told to move a mountain or boulder.  But that really the dogs that "win" are those that are not even at the race at all.  They are in a meadow or park.  Sometimes the best way to win is to not play at all.  That really stuck with me.  Pull out, let go and release.
