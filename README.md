# My View of Human Consiousness
Try to keep to 1,000 lines with ample references and documentation to allow readers to go down whichever rabbit hole they desire.

* note: as of writing this first draft it is actually a recount of my past belief structures.  I will record them here, then update accordingly, all writings in the first versions should be viewed under the lense that it is retrospective and hence might not be true representations of how I actually felt in the moment.  I will start around the age 18 and work up to my current age of 30 :)
