I do not proclaim to know absolute truth, this is a living document intended to change and adapt.  Please help me form it through giving feedback, posting issues and branching when appropriate.  

Particularly important are the ideas of [Relative Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism) and [Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) in explaining dual and sometimes opposing ideas at play.

Please do not get angry or try to think I am intentionally being confusing or inflamatory. If you start feeling negative emotions, stop for a moment, possibly read my [context](./context.md) file and go back through the history of commits to better understand the context at which I am approaching this.

# My View of Human Consiousness
Consciousness is a type of growing organism that spans space and time and exists in us as it does in animals, plants etc.  This `being` / `force` / `god` instils yearnings and hungering in the material of this reality as it's mechanism for it's growth. 

All things can testify of it's presence and completeness - be that words, feelings, dreams, experiences, meditative thoughts, pain, joy chemical interactions -- everything can be a vehicle to spur love and growth.  

The same way we understand the yearnings of [Monarch Butterflies to fly to Mexico as a multi-generational impulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly), we feel the importance of love and innescapably push forward towards that as survival while at the same time survival of the fittest helps our consciousness shape and mold the most effecient vehicle for itself.  Never leaving anything by the wayside, always regenerating, re-using, learning and strengthening through generations of time.  

Language has had a hard time labeling this correctly, so causes confusion.  For example: the word `love` -- a child can scream they `love` candy, the `love` shared between two people, `love` from a mother to her offspring and god being `love` all have different depths and meanings, yet in english we use the same word to describe them.  I believe all spritual, consciousness and inner awareness practices are trying to connect our ego with this same consciousness. 

[Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus), [Allah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah), [Jehova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah), [Ellohiem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim), [I am that I am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_that_I_Am), [Gravity](https://touchysubjects.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/gravity-is-love-love-is-gravity/), [Various Sun Gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_solar_deities) 

We are all intertwined with this consciousness.  It exists in and around us. The part is an essential piece of the whole and the whole doesn't exist without the part. We are at the same time seperated and joined but at different locations in space, and different intervals in time.
