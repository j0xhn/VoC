## TL;DR
Consciousness is a type of growing organism that spans space and time and exists in us as it does in animals, plants etc.  This `being` / `force` / `god` instils yearnings in material of this reality as it's mechanism for growth. 

All things can testify of it's presence and completeness - be that words, feelings, dreams, experiences, meditative thoughts, pain, joy chemical interactions -- everything can be a vehicle to spur love and growth.  

The same way we understand the yearnings of [Monarch Butterflies to fly to Mexico as a multi-generational impulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly), we feel the importance of love and innescapably push forward towards that as survival while at the same time survival of the fittest helps our consciousness shape and mold the most effecient vehicle for itself.  Never leaving anything by the wayside, always regenerating, re-using, learning strengthening.  

Through Christ we are one. We are the great I AM. Christ is I, I AM CHRIST.

But that's just my perspective from my small space in the human family consciousness.  Another branch exists under other thought leaders such as Buddha or Muhammad.  But it doesn't matter, becuase they all testify of that existance which inspired them.  All that is light is of God / Allah / Jehova / Ellohiem / Love.  All who will listen will here their master, follow and serve.

The part is an essential piece of the whole and the whole doesn't exist without the part, they are at the same time seperated and joined but at different places on a spectrum.  [The spirit and the body are the soul of man](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.15-16). And we are the [body of Christ](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-27.html), the Son of God on our migration towards the next phase of ourselves.
