I do not proclaim to know absolute truth, this is a living document intended to change and adapt.  Please help me form it through giving feedback, posting issues and branching when appropriate.  

Particularly important are the ideas of [Relative Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relativism) and [Quantum Mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) in explaining dual and sometimes opposing ideas at play.

Please do not get angry or try to think I am intentionally being confusing or inflamatory. If you start feeling negative emotions, stop for a moment, possibly read my [context](./context.md) file and go back through the history of commits to better understand the context at which I am approaching this.

# My View of Consiousness
Consciousness is a type of growing organism that spans space and time and exists in us as it does in animals, plants etc.  This consciousness instils yearnings and hungering in the material of this reality as it's mechanism for growth.  I believe this to be `god` -- but don't want to inherit pre-concieved notions when trying to explain my view to others, so will use the acronym `URGE - Underlying Recessive Gravitational Existance`. 

All things testify of it's presence and completeness - be that words, happiness, sadness, dreams, experiences, meditative thoughts, pain, pleasure and chemicals -- everything can be a vehicle to spur it's growth. Everything you want to do is some variation on all possible routes forward.  Synchronicity is when those similiar variations connect with each other forming stronger patterns.

The same way we understand the urges of [Monarch Butterflies to fly to Mexico as a multi-generational impulse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monarch_butterfly), we feel the importance of love and innescapably push forward towards that as survival while at the same time, selective breeding and what some call "survival of the fittest" helps our urge shape and mold it's physical vessels into the most effecient vehicle for expansion given the restraints of existance.  Never leaving anything by the wayside, always regenerating, learning and strengthening through generations of time.  

I imagine my current life as if living inside the viens of a leaf, human or lighting bolt.

I like lighting because most of it happens so fast and on a level that is impercievable by our senses.  We see the light and hear the sound, but that isn't actually the lightning, it is merely the physical manifestations of the heat produced by lightning.  Which is how I imagine trying to understand this Urge. It is beyond our current comprehension.  Any attempt to put it into writing is immediatly lacking and imcomplete due to the inherit and neccessary boundries established in order to form communication of any type.

For example: the word `love` -- a child can scream they `love` candy, the `love` shared between two people, `love` from a mother to her offspring and god being `love` all have different depths and meanings, yet in english we use the same word to describe them. 

Now imagine that this lighting bolt spreads like a pyramid and our life is as if this lighting bolt was frozen in time, and a cross section has been taken from it.  In essence forming a plane with different shapes and sizes.  The size and shape of your current URGE determines your vehicle.  One size of URGE resulting in the consciousness of a pig, another in a human, another in a gut bacteria that exists inside of a human, another in a venus fly trap, and another in a particle of pollen.

During our lifetime what is true for one URGE is not true for another, but if time can be flattened will become one joint truth. It is true one person has white skin, another black.  Neither white nor black are truths, yet both are true to themselves.

[Christ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesus), [Allah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allah), [Jehova](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jehovah), [Ellohiem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elohim), [I am that I am](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Am_that_I_Am), [Gravity](https://touchysubjects.wordpress.com/2016/01/25/gravity-is-love-love-is-gravity/), [Various Sun Gods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_solar_deities) 

We are intertwined with our urges and the urges of others.  It exists in and around us. The part is an essential piece of the whole and the whole doesn't exist without the part. We are at the same time seperated and joined but at different locations in space, and different intervals in time like atoms in a river that splits and then joins back in on itself.
