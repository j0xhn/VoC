**A note to the reader:**
Please read my [context](./context.md) and [history files](./myFormation.md) and go back through the previous versions to understand how I came to my current views for a more broad and insightful understanding.

# My View on God
Consciousness is a type of growing organism that spans space and time and exists in us as it does in animals, plants etc.  This consciousness instils yearnings and hungering in the material of this reality as it's mechanism for growth.  I believe this to be `God / URGE` -- don't want to inherit pre-concieved notions that limit God to only the realm of "Truth" and "Love" and acknowledge - a more mysterious but still has important name of `URGE - Underlying Recessive Gravitational Existance`. Which is very similar and somehow attached to the soul of a man.

Simply put, God is both what we idealize Love to be, and it's opposite. If it helps you understand better God is All. Hate or Apathy are typically brought to my mind, or even brutal enforcement of will is not outside of these realms but lives beyond our conception of good and evil and is the more like the idea/feeling/expression/quest/purpose of instinct. As soon as we try to put it into words, images or metaphors we fall short, and as soon as we try to understand what it feels like to someone else, we immediately understand that we cannot.  It's personally intimate, yet universal - because it is based in feeling - pure feeling.

I don't like to think of this entity as having a preset character or personality but somehow hope it does, as a foreshadowing that we have the ability to become hole, maintain certain unique characteristics and attain this high position. How is being that came into existance or its characteristics are beyond my ability or sensetivity to discern. Was it the first sentient being advanced through natural evolution? Did this take place in our planet, universe or reality? How and why does it interact with us humans the way it does. Perhaps it mattereth not, and is enough to see it in pattern as humans interact with entities we consider inferior -- as we are with animals -- and embodies the feeling of other - interesting yet not quite safe or understood. 

Perhaps it started very small, as if in the middle of space, when nothing suddenly exploded into something or between rock & ocean in some type of lichen or moss with bacteria and minerals joined with light and lightning from the sun and sky.  We typically view it as our creator, but this could also be a story passed down by a race with advanced biotech as found in Sumarian lore. 

Nevertheless, we are intertwined with our urges and the urges of others.  It exists in and around us. Trully we are all somewhat connected, but by varying degrees of influence in likeness such as with the droplets of water in an ocean.  The part is an essential piece of the whole and the whole doesn't exist without these essential pieces. We are at the same time seperated and joined but at different locations in space, and different intervals in time like atoms in a river that split and then join back in on itself like the branches of lightning: imperceptible to our natural senses insomuch that we don't actually ever see pure lighting, we only see the effects it has on our natural world and can feel it when running through our bodies.


Through time humans have tried to define and understand our URGEs - sometimes for light and sometimes for dark.  Many traditions have formed writings, rules and models -- that while incomplete or wrong in some ways -- are often usefull in helping society move forward on the same page.  The idea of God continues to evolve according to societies needs, often borrowing old ideas and incorporating new urges that we need to address. It's an internal discovery proccess, both in how we deal with ourselves but also how we deal with others.  Ultimately it only exists if there are others to exist with it.

I tell you these things that ye may learn wisdom; that ye may learn that when ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God. God is community, rewarding reliablity and tending towards long standing relationships. 

Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the first and greatest commandment. And the second is like it: ‚ÄòLove your neighbor as yourself.‚Äô All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments.  It is and will always be a personal thing, yet always requires at least two. For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them. Its different to everyone and yet, the same to everyone. IT exits because IAM.

One who says they comprehend that which is incomprehesible is by definition immediately mistook.  As such are we sentenced to eternally seek? Possibly to rest in an every changing glory of power once we surrender to the mystery of the unknown while at the same time tapping into it's unmeasurable power? Only death has the answer.

it is above light/dark - love/hate - finding itself in the understanding that one denotes and defines the other

Encompasing of all we can imagine

Ordered Chaos

Love Rage
