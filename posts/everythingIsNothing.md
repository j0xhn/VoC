## Everything is Nothing

I’ve been trying to find a way to help others understand this simple concept that sometimes what we use to represent something, really isn’t anything at all. It applies to god, government, religion, meditation, diets, meditation techniques — you name it, all completely subsist of emptiness. As the buddhists say “form out of emptiness — emptiness out of form”

I will be using the idea of God as the basis of my current stance. I hope to show that God is meaningful, yet also completely empty and based on nothing at the same time.

Emptiness you say?! Well that’s ridiculous!
Emptiness is really something, in fact it’s everything.
The following post is an attempt to explain myself and the paradox this creates.

I could talk in circles all day, but find the language of math helpful in illustrating the connections of how I get to the statement “everything is nothing” as long as we share a common understanding of a few things, principally that God is love.

In mathematics you can easily go down this path:

a=b<br>
b=c<br>
a=c

using words this looks like this:

god is love<br>
love is no thing<br>
god is nothing<br>

or to take it a step further and bring it full circle back to your person and every thought, sight, sound or smell that has ever entered into your brain as making up the fabric of the universe:<br>
god is love<br>
god is everything (alpha & omega)<br>
love is everything<br>
love is no one “thing”<br>
god is nothing yet everything<br>
you are a part of everything<br>
you are nothing<br>
you are god<br>
u = ♥

Now this isn’t me saying that I don’t believe in God. Oh heaven’s no.
What fun would that be?! In fact, I try to find God in everything.
At this point you may be thinking “this is crazy” in which I would respond with — you’re absolutely right.

The whole thing, life, the probability of me existing right now, at this keyboard typing this out is crazy. An amazing amount of statistical improbability had to happen in order for this exact moment to occur. The fastest sperm, meeting the right egg in my parents, their parent’s parents through generations of time. The chance of me existing has got to be some inconceivable number. Yet I do. And that’s crazy.

Just for this post, suspend your belief in moral absolute truth and embrace paradox and relativism. It exists in nature with quantum mechanics, and I’ll dig into paradox and Truth in a later post, but for now, please just… be comfortable accepting that opposing ideas and what we commonly call “truth” can simultaneously exist.

If this seems foreign to you, and that you could never agree to think this way, please consider your relationship with Santa Clause.

Some humans believe Santa exists as an actual being on earth, typically small children. Others believe that he does not exist in a physical sense at all, but that doesn’t stop us them from telling others that he exists or acting accordingly. Both believers and unbelievers receive presents at Christmas time — regardless of belief.

The belief of physical existence of a magical trespassing joyful elf continues for some until they reach an age of reason capable of understanding that the IDEA of Santa is really what exists. So when we “lie” to children telling them that Santa is going to bring them presents, it really isn’t a lie at all as long as there is the understanding that the idea of Santa in our cultural context is the active force bringing them presents.

In short Santa is both real, and non existent depending on what level you are reasoning about him on. That is also how I feel about God.
Santa is both the idea, as well as the people that buy the presents. God is the people around us that help us feel love. That comfort us in times of need and feed us in times of hunger.

This idea is not new, it’s been told time and time again, by different people in different cultures through time and history, illustrated by the following mashup poem of famous sayings of Jesus, Kabir and the sermon of King Benjamin:

It’s as if God is saying<br>
I am in the next seat.<br>
My shoulder is against yours.<br>
you will not find me in the stupas,<br>
not in Indian shrine rooms,<br>
nor in synagogues,<br>
nor in cathedrals:<br>
not in masses,<br>
nor in temples,<br>
not in legs winding around your own neck,<br>
nor in eating nothing but vegetables,<br>
nor your solitary meditation regiment.<br>
When you really look for me,<br>
you will see me instantly —<br>
you will find me in the tiniest moment of time,<br>
in the very least of these my brethren.<br>
For verily verily I say unto all:<br>
when you are in the service of your fellow being<br>
you are only in the service of your God.

God is love.
Organized religion — Church of Jesus Christ — has helped me grow my own love and has helped me focus love towards others.
Meditation and stepping away from some of the guidelines given by organized religion has also helped me feel and share stronger love towards others, myself and even paradoxically my relationship towards the flawed organized religion I am a part of.

Jesus gives me hope.
That is my faith.
