## Everything is Nothing.

I've been trying to find a way to help others understand that simple concept in my relation to god, government, religion, meditation, vegeanism, my meditation techniques -- you name it, all completely made up of emptiness. As the buddhists say - "form out of emptiness -- emptiness out of form"

Emptiness you say? Well I call bullshit!  
Emptiness is really something, infact it's everything!  
The following post is an attempt to explain myself.

In mathematics you can easily go down this path:

a=b
b=c
a=c

yet somehow in religion and words 
it is hard to achieve the same effect:

god is love
love is no thing
god is nothing

or to take it a step further in order to include every thought, sight, sound or smell that has ever entered into your brain:

god is love
god is everything (alpha & omega)
love is everything
love is no one "thing"
god is nothing yet everything
you are a part of everything
you are nothing
you are god
u = ♥

Now this isn't me saying that I don't believe in God. Oh heaven's no. What fun would that be?!  Infact, I believe God is both everything and nothing.

At this point you may be thinking - this is crazy - in which I would respond with "you're absolutely right".  

The whole thing, life, the probability of me existing right now, at this keyboard typing this out is crazy.  An amazing amount of statistical improbability had to happen in order for this exact moment to occur. The right sperm, meeting the right egg in my parents, and their parent's parents through generations of time. The chance of me existing has got to be some inconcievable number. Yet I do. And that's crazy.  

Just for this post, suspend your belief in absolute truth and embrace paradox.  It exists in nature with quantum mechanics, and I'll dig into paradox and Truth in a later post, but for now, please just... be comfortable accepting that opposing ideas and what we commonly call "truth" can simultanously exist.

For example, Santa Clause.
Children believe Santa exists, we know however that he does not.  That doesn't stop us from telling them they exist, and they recieve presents that re-inforce this belief until they reach an age of reason capable of understanding that the IDEA of Santa is really what exists.  So when we "lie" to children telling them that Santa is going to bring them presents, it really isn't a lie at all as long as there is the understanding that the IDEA of Santa in our cultural context is the active force bringing them presents.  IE Santa is both real, and non-existant depending on what level you are reasoning about it on.

That is how I feel about God.

When seeking for God,
just look in the mirror
or more helpful is in the next seat. This is a slightly altered version of the famous poem by Kabir and the sermon of King Benjamin:

It's as if God is saying
I am in the next seat.
My shoulder is against yours.
you will not find me in the stupas,
not in Indian shrine rooms,
nor in synagogues,
nor in cathedrals:
not in masses,
nor in temples,
nor kirtans,
not in legs winding around your own neck,
nor in eating nothing but vegetables,
or your awesome meditation regiment.
When you really look for me,
you will see me instantly —
you will find me in the tiniest moment of time,
and unto the very least of these my bretheren.
For verily verily I say unto thee
when you are in the service of your fellow being
you are in the service of your God.

God is love.
That is my testimony.

In the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
