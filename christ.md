ἐγώ

I am the Bread of Life (John 6:35)
I am the Light of the World (John 8:12)
I am the Door (John 10:9)
I am the Good Shepherd (John 10:11,14)
I am the Resurrection and the Life (John 11:25)
I am the Way and the Truth and the Life (John 14:6)
I am the Vine (John 15:1,5)

I am that I am
Through Christ we are one. We are the great I AM. Christ is I, I AM CHRIST.

[The spirit and the body are the soul of man](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/88.15-16). And we are the [body of Christ](https://biblehub.com/1_corinthians/12-27.html), the Son of God on our migration towards the next phase of ourselves.
